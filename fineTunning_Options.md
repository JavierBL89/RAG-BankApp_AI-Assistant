Hey! That’s a great thought — and yes, **fine-tuning** could absolutely work for your RAG system **if you want to tailor the model’s behavior** to your banking domain.

Let’s walk through your ideas and whether they’re viable — especially with **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** like **LoRA** and other alternatives.

## 🎯 When to Fine-Tune in RAG Systems

Fine-tuning is useful when:

* You want your model to better understand domain-specific terminology (e.g., banking, regulations).
* The base model (like GPT-3.5 or Mistral) doesn’t answer well even with good context retrieval.
* You want to align tone, style, or structure of responses (e.g., more formal, concise, etc.).

But **you don’t always need full fine-tuning**. That’s where PEFT comes in.

## 🔧 PEFT Techniques You Mentioned

### ✅ 1. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

* Freezes all pretrained layers.
* Adds **small trainable low-rank adapters** into transformer attention layers.
* Lightweight, fast, cheap to train (can run on consumer GPUs).
* Works well with models like **Mistral**, **LLaMA**, **Falcon**, etc.

✅ *Perfect for your case if you want to slightly adjust a model (e.g., Mistral) for the banking domain.*

### ✅ 2. **Last-Layer Fine-Tuning**

* Freeze all layers except the **final linear projection** (output).
* Minimal risk of overfitting or breaking the model.
* Less flexible than LoRA — doesn’t adapt deeper reasoning layers.

🔍 *Good for tasks like classification or QA where you just need a tiny push toward your target distribution.*

### ⚖️ LoRA vs. Last-Layer Fine-Tuning

| Feature        | LoRA                         | Last Layer Tuning               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Flexibility    | High – adjusts attention     | Low – adjusts only output layer |
| Training time  | Short                        | Very short                      |
| Memory usage   | Low                          | Very low                        |
| Output quality | Better for reasoning/tone    | OK for style/labels             |
| Model support  | Works well with Transformers | Universal                       |

## 🧠 Should You Do It?

For your RAG system:

* If **retrieval is strong but generation is generic or incorrect**, LoRA could help.
* If **your responses are mostly okay, but you want a custom style or tone**, consider last-layer tuning.
* If you’re using **OpenAI GPT-3.5**, **you can't fine-tune directly** — you'd need to switch to **open models** like:

  * **Mistral**
  * **LLaMA**
  * **Falcon**
  * **TinyLLaMA** (if hardware is a constraint)

---

## 🚀 Suggested Path

1. Try your RAG with standard Mistral + quality context first.
2. If not good enough:

   * Fine-tune Mistral using LoRA on 50–100 high-quality banking Q\&A pairs.
3. Use `peft` + `transformers` + `bitsandbytes` for fast tuning.
