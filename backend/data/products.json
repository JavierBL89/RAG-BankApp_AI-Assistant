We are here to help you, providing as much guidance and advice as you want or need. Every step of the way. Step 1: Find out how much you can borrow & get House-Hunter Approval\n\nYou will need to know what you can afford before you start looking for the right home – our mortgage calculator can give you a good indication.\n\nWe will help you through your mortgage application. If successful, we can give you a “House Hunter” approval if you haven’t found a suitable property – this gives you time to search for your new home. If your application is not successful this time, don’t give up. There may be steps you can take to improve your chances of approval – e.g. a longer savings period or a reduced loan amount. We can talk you through your options.\n\nStep 2: Choose a location & find the right home\n\nOnce you’ve found the home that’s right for you, let us know the address and the purchase price.\n\nStep 3: Get your Letter of Offer and appoint a solicitor\n\nWe will send a loan offer pack to you and to your solicitor. It will contain your Letter of Offer, the European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS) with full details of your mortgage and the terms and conditions of your loan.\n\nStep 4: Get a property valuation\n\nWe will give you the name of an approved valuer who can carry out a valuation for us before the loan is drawn down. We always recommend that you get a surveyor’s report as well, for your own peace of mind, which can uncover faults that aren’t easy to see. In some cases we may require that you get one, particularly if the house you’re buying is older.\n\nStep 5: Arrange Home Insurance & Life Cover\n\nAt this stage, you should arrange the appropriate Life Assurance and Fire Insurance policies to protect both you and the property. These will need to be in place before you can draw down your mortgage. Ask us about our great value Home Insurance and Life Cover1.\n\nStep 6: Exchange contracts and pay your deposit\n\nYour solicitor and the seller’s solicitor will tie up the details.\n\nStep 7: Draw down your mortgage\n\nWe will draw down your Mortgage and issue the funds to your solicitor to complete the purchase.\n\n\n\n\n1\nYou may purchase your Home Insurance / Life cover from another provider if you wish."

Consider what kind of lifestyle you see for yourself. Do you plan to travel every year? Enjoy big occasions and celebrations and spoil the grandkids with trips and family adventures to the zoo or the panto?You may need an income for up to 30 years once you retire so setting realistic expectations of the lifestyle you want and knowing how much you will need to have saved for your retirement years is vital.Know how to get thereGetting expert advice is critical to having a good understanding of what you need to do in order to have a comfortable retirement. Many think the whole area of pensions is too complicated. Our advisors have a wealth of experience and they can explain and guide you through the process to get a plan in place that’s right for you. Don’t put it off until tomorrow Many people think that putting a retirement plan in place is too complicated. But pensions are simply long term savings that help you to pay for the things you want whenever you stop working so it makes sense to organise yours now. Most pensions are very flexible. You can usually stop and start when you need to, and increase or decrease your contributions at any time. The earlier you start the better, even if you can only put in less than you would like to.  The longer you save the more chance you have of achieving your retirement goals. Our advisors can make understanding pensions easy. They’re available to meet with you face to face, or via virtual meeting or chat with you over the phone to talk through your pension needs. "

              "content": "I’m Patricia, I’m 42 and I’m married to my husband Lorcan and we have two children, aged 9 and 6. We’re living in Kilkenny on my family farm, recently passed to me by my father. We live in the farmhouse, keeping me close to the farm at all times but close enough to the local village and schools for the kids. My family have been part of this community for generations so we’re well connected in the community. The kids are heavily involved with the local GAA and other sports and Lorcan is a landscaper so a lot of his work is local too. Farming is in my blood so I couldn’t see myself doing anything else. As always, it has its ups and downs but thankfully we’re having a few good years now with barley and wheat. Lorcan’s work has also become more stable than recent years gone by. The re-zoning of land close to the village for residential building has really given his landscaping business a boost. What plans do you have around retirement?  Read MoreWith a young family, over the years our priorities have been more short term focused but now is the time to start planning properly for our future. We recently put a savings plan in place for the children’s future college education but one piece of advice my father gave me when taking over the farm was to get a pension started and so I did! It wasn’t much at the time but it has got me into a good savings habit. Farming is tough, physical work and I’ve seen the toll it can take so ideally, I’d like to wind down a bit in my 60’s. I probably won’t retire in one go but I’ve a few hobbies, such as bee keeping that will keep me busy. Some people I know say that their farm is their pension but that is fine if you plan to sell it – I see it that Lorcan and I are just minding it for the next generation – it has been in our family for centuries now. Putting a plan in place now for the future is a smart move. I won’t be prepared to retire when I want to if I don’t, so getting professional advice was paramount to me. When I spoke to the advisor in my local Bank of Ireland branch, the message they gave me was simple – some of what you earn this year is to be spent this year; some needs to be put aside for what may be needed next year and then a portion is for the future when I stop working. What decisions do you need to make? I don’t work nine to five, five days a week with a salary paid into my account on the same day every month. I also know all too well that the weather can change my fortunes as can the prices that I can achieve for my crops. So that’s why I put aside what I can every month and take a closer look at it when I’m dealing with my tax return in November.My plan and the decisions we make when adjusting the plan is all about what is right for us as a family and as a farming business. I’m always happy to hear how saving for our future retirement also allows me to cut down my tax bill. I know we need my money to grow and this means some ups and downs along the way. That goes with business and with life but my aim is to build up a healthy pot for when it’s time for me to retire. This means that from time to time we may have to “cut our cloth” and drop back on the pension savings for a few months but we’d like to get back on track as soon as we can. But also, in the better years, put a little extra aside.My pension plan allows me to put aside what I can, when I can, and that’s exactly the flexibility I need!"

I wouldn’t have thought I’d ever become a Director of a business but I took the opportunity from some of the inheritance my parents left me. Mum and Dad would have wanted me to be secure and set up for life and I think that is exactly what buying into the business has given me. Since my parents passed away, I’ve thought a lot about my finances and it dawned on me, it’s up to me to look after myself into the future. Having met with my financial advisor a couple of times recently, I feel there’s a weight lifted off my shoulders, having put a plan in place for critical illness and health insurance – I needed to make sure I’ll be ok financially if something bad were to happen to me. And I know it’s time to focus on putting a plan in place for the type of lifestyle I want when I retire. I’m a good saver, I don’t have any real debts and with my parents’ inheritance, I’ve a decent bit of savings for any rainy days that may come my way. But, I do know how to look after myself. I love going on lovely city trips and vacations throughout the year and myself and my friends have a really good time so I don’t want that to stop when I finally retire. What decisions do you need to make around planning for the future?  Read MoreI met with my financial advisor, giving them a clear picture of what I have and “where I am” with my finances. It really was time well spent – for both of us. I hadn’t put much thought into the different pension pots I had been saving into over the years with different employers and nor had I considered what the buying into the business would mean for me in terms of pension options. As a business that is going through change, we’ve collectively taken the time to reflect on the goals we have for the company. Part of this is taking care of our future retirement plans. Our accountant spoke to us about the benefits of pensions in terms of reducing our income tax bill and we think we have a plan that is flexible and adaptable for each of our needs. I’m amazed at how much the company could contribute for me and not just that – we could claim corporate tax relief on it too. The tax breaks really make it affordable and attractive. The advice I got really helped me to work out how much I could put in and what was the best way to get my pension pot growing. Paying in on a monthly basis what you can afford and then topping it up at the end of the year to maximise tax savings is great. It sounded complicated at first but when you have a plan in place, it all made perfect sense. I now know what my advisor means when she says “It’s all about the future you!”  "

              "content": "I’m Brian and I’m 63. I’ve worked in hospitality for the last 36 years as a hotel manager. I started out at the bottom and worked my way up to where I am today so I think it’s safe to say I’ve seen it all. Covid has been a blessing and a curse for me. It was awful to see the hotel shut for such a long stretch and it’s taking a lot to get it back up and running but on a personal level, having to slow down and not go to work every day was a good insight to what retirement might be like. What plans have you around retirement? My wife Aileen has retired already. She was the secretary at our local secondary school for a number of years once our own children grew up and flew the nest so she’s already receiving a modest pension along with the State Pension. We see ourselves living a modest lifestyle in retirement. We love playing golf but a lot of our time is spent with our family, our kids and our grandkids. Our girls live locally but our son lives in Canada with his family so we don’t get to see them often. We’d like to do a bit more travel once we retire, go to visit Stephen and the family and then we’d love to go to the Ryder Cup in the States in 2025. I never really gave my pension or what I was saving into it much consideration until recently but having worked for nearly the last forty years, I can now see the benefit of both myself and my employer putting in small regular contributions and having it build up over time. When I got a promotion about ten years ago, a friend at the time advised me to do some AVCs. This has really bumped up the overall pot. What money I’ll have to spend every week will look very different because of the little extra I put in over time. I’m ready for retirement, so we’re planning on making the most of saving into my pension for the next few years while I’m working and then to enjoy life once I retire. I’m hoping to retire in about two years so the money we put away won’t be locked away for long. What decisions do Brian & Aileen need to make?  Read MoreMaking a plan is key! Having recently sat down with my Bank of Ireland advisor, I now have a clear picture of what my incomings and outgoings are, allowing us to clearly see what is realistic to save towards my pension for the next few years. Secondly, having that discussion about the options available to me when I do retire gave me a sense of what my “retirement income” will be. I’ve always looked at my pension pot as one big number but never before considered what that actually gave me annually to live off in retirement. I know I’ve a big decision to make about how I decide to draw down my pension but getting advice on the options now before retiring is something that I’m glad I’ve done sooner rather than later. The plan gives us clarity for the future. With a few years before I finish at the hotel, I know I still have some time to add to my pension pot while taking every advantage of the tax breaks. Getting the right amount of growth without taking on too much risk is important for us at this stage. We remember inflation in the 1980s so we know we need to try and make sure our money grows to keep pace with the rising cost of living. We were told that our plan should be suitable to meet our goals but still allows us to sleep at night. And that’s exactly what it is!"
