    "content": "A personal loan lets you borrow money for things like a wedding, a once in a lifetime holiday, or a large purchase. With our personal loans, you get a lump sum of money — between €2,000 and €75,000. You then pay it back with interest over a set time, from 1 to 5 years. You can choose to make payments every week or every month, depending on what works best for you. You do not need to offer anything as security to apply. We look at your credit history to decide if you qualify. "
