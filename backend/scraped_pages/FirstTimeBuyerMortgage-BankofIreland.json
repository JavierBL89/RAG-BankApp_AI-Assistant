We may be able to lend you more than this so it’s important to talk to us as early as possible about your plans. The amount you can borrow will depend on your individual circumstances and is subject to lending criteria, terms and conditions. First-time buyers can borrow up to 90% of the property value. In the table below, we have an example of this:"
