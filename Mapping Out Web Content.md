In order to make a fucntional AI assistant for a Web Banking app also for only educational purposes, we only index the best defined content in the app.
These appplications are usually reach in content with lots of options for navigation, and not always meaningul content in pages for a AI assistant.


At this time, I think mapping out some of the web content manually is necessary for organizing the different products and tools, and to make the content them easy to iterate, chunk or convert to text, and cleaner for vector db.

        "description": " ",
